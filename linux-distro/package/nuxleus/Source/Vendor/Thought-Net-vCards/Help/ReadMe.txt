
The SHFB file in this folder is a project file for Sandcastle Help File Builder.
SHFB is an open source documentation generator based on the Microsoft Sandcastle
system.  You can download it from www.codeplex.com (search for it).  SHFB converts
XML comments into professionally-formatted documentation (such as a CHM file).

vCard.chm contains an example output (in HTML Help 1.x format).

This is using version 1.3.3.1 of SHFB.  A newer version of Sandcastle is available
and will be upgraded in the next release.  You may receive errors rebuilding
this help file with versions released after 1.3.3.1.
