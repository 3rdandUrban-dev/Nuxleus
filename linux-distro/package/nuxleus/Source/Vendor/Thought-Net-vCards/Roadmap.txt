
Upcoming Plans
--------------

Version 0.4 (late September 2007)

  - This release will focus on stabilization: bug fixes,
    updated documentation, more unit tests, and rebranding
    the library under a more generic name.  No major
    enhancements are expected unless significent elements
    are missing.


Version 0.5 (October or November 2007)

  - Support for hCard and RDF formats.
  - Feel free to work on these formats now (inherit from vCardWriter/vCardReader).


Version 0.6 and beyond...

  - Send your suggestions.
