<h1>FeedSync Notes Sample</h1>

<p>
Thank you for your interest in FeedSync! This project will serve as 
a set of sample applications that utilize FeedSync for various scenarios.
</p>

<p>
This program is modeled after the Notes Gadget that ships with 
Windows Vista (tm). The gadget represents a stack of sticky notes and the user 
can create, edit and delete a set of notes. The sample app demonstrates the 
same feature set, however the notes themselves are stored in a local file on 
disk and can be synchronized with a FeedSync enabled RSS or Atom feed.
</p>
<h4>
Note: This project was created using Visual Studio .NET 2005. It has not been tested with other versions.

<h2>Getting started:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Copy the project files and source code to your local directory.</li>
<li>Compile and run the FeedSyncNotesSample application.</li>
<li>Create some notes by editing the text view, or adding new notes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>To create a feed that can be used with this project:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Login or create an account on <a href="http://feedsync.mslivelabs.com/">http://feedsync.mslivelabs.com/</a></li>
<li>On the "manage feeds" page there is a link to the feed itself labeled "complete feed".</li>
<li>Copy the URL for this feed.</li>
<li>In the sample application select the Options -> Sync menu item and paste 
   the feed url.</li>
<li>The notes from the application will now be synchronized with the local data
   file created by the application.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<p>
The web service at feedsync.mslivelabs.com can create public or private feeds. 
Private feeds require authorization and can be configured to allow read or 
read/write access. At this time private feeds are not supported by the sample 
application.
</p>

<p>
The sample can support RSS or Atom formats. Currently this is a constant 
defined in the MainForm.cs class. To change formats you will need to delete 
the local data file after modifying the code. A future version will offer this
as an option from within the application.
