// ASN.1 BER encoding library by Malcolm Crowe at the University of the West of Scotland
// See http://cis.paisley.ac.uk/crow-ci0
// This is version 0 of the library, please advise me about any bugs
// mailto:malcolm.crowe@paisley.ac.uk

// Restrictions: It is assumed that no encoding has a length greater than 2^31-1.
// UNIVERSAL TYPES
// Some of the more unusual Universal encodings are supported but not fully implemented
// Should you require these types, as an alternative to changing this code
// you can catch the exception that is thrown and examine the contents yourself.
// APPLICATION TYPES
// If you want to handle Application types systematically, you can derive a class from
// Universal, and provide the Creator and Creators methods for your class
// You will see an example of how to do this in the Snmplib
// CONTEXT AND PRIVATE TYPES
// Ad hoc coding can be used for these, as an alterative to derive a class as above.
