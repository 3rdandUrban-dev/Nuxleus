WebSocket4Net

WebSocket4Net is a .NET implementation of WebSocket client.

It originates from SuperWebSocket WebSocket Client. For better developing of the websocket client, it was separated from SuperWebSocket and was renamed to WebSocket4Net.
WebSocket4Net aims to provide a crossplatform, simple and standard websocket client implementation.
Currently, it has released assemblies for many different runtimes:
* .Net 2.0
* .Net 3.5
* .Net 4.0
* Mono
* Silverlight
* WindowsPhone
* Mono for Android

In the future, assembly for MonoTouch also will be provided.


What is WebSocket?

WebSocket is a technology providing for bi-directional, full-duplex communications channels, over a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) socket.
It is designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers but it can be used by any client or server application.
The WebSocket API is being standardized by the W3C and the WebSocket protocol is being standardized by the IETF.
Please refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets.
