Mango is an easy to use, easy to test, high performance web application framework that stays out of your way and makes your life ridiculously simple.

The Main Features of Mango:

 - **Mango creates stand alone web applications** that don't rely on Apache, IIS or any other web server, the server is bundled into the .exe file with the rest of your application.  This allows for easy deployment, easy upgrades and absolutely no configuration. 

 - **High performance and scalable.**  Modeled after tornadoweb, the technology that powers friend feed, Mango is capable of thousands of simultaneous connections, ideal for applications that create persistent connections with the server.

 - **An easy to use, high performance template engine** Mango comes bundled with a designer friendly templating language. Just beause the template engine is easy to use, doesn't mean its slow though.  Mango's template engine precompiles your templates to IL so there are no startup costs and templates are rendered lightning fast.
