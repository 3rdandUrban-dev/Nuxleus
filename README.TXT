SuperSocket

SuperSocket is a light weight extensible socket application framework.
You can use it to build a command based server side socket application easily without thinking about how to use socket,
how to maintain the socket connections and how socket works(synchronize/asynchronize).

It is a pure C# project which is designed to be extended, so it is easy to be integrated to your existing system.
As long as your systems (like forum/CRM/MIS/HRM/ERP) are developed in .NET language,
you must be able to use SuperSocket to build your socket application as a part of your current system perfectly.
