1.1.0 => 1.1.1
===============
o Optimizations in serialization of messages and the dispatching mechanism means a performance gain of roughly factor 4-12
  when dispatching messages between workers on the same node, depending on the type of content in the message.

1.0.0 => 1.1.0
===============
o Added the virtual methods OnRemoteNodeRegistered(ushort) and OnRemoteNodeUnregistered(ushort) to Worker.
  Override these methods if your worker is depending on such notifications.
o Added a specialized node proxy that can cache unchangeable values, instead of the autogenerated proxy from
  ProxyFactory. This will improve performance, but not on a scale that is measurable. This improves the
  overall design, however, since it is desirable to cache anything that makes sense on the client side
  proxy.
o Changed the maximum value for a message type from 2,000,000 to 2,147,483,647. All negative values are
  reserved for system message types.
