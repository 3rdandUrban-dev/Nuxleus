Version 2.0.3.0
January 10, 2008

This release of TagLib# features many bug fixes and a complete rework of the
documentation to better serve the Windows community. Fixes include:
	* Make Asf.Tag enumerable.
	* Don't duplicate genres stored in "(0)Blues" format.
	* Save Id3v2.RelativeVolumeFrame as XRVA and XRV in ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.2.
	* Insert new comments before other comment frames in Id3v2.Tag
	* Use CultureInfo.CurrentCulture to get the correct comment language in
	  Id3v2.Tag.
	* Skip iTunes comments in Id3v2.CommentsFrame.
	* Save multi-string values as a single box with a semicolon separator
	  in Mpeg4.AppleTag to improve compatability with iTunes.
	* Make the Id3v2.Tag.DefaultVersion = 3 because most commercial programs
	  have some crippling ID3v2.4 problem.
	* Added Id3v2.Tag.IsCompilation
	* Don't crash on misformatted field in XiphComment.
	* Recognize the .divx extension as a RIFF file.
	* Use one byte rather than four to store compilation in Mpeg4.AppleTag.
	* Don't check the image format flags anymore in Mpeg4.AppleTag, just use
	  the file contents.
	* Don't crash in NonContainer.EndTag when the file is less than 128
	  bytes.
	* Allow saving of multi-page comment packets in Ogg through massive
	  rewrite of pagination.
	* Allow correct reading of multi-page comment packets in Ogg.Bitstream.
	* Use try/finally on all load and save operations to prevent files from
	  being left open.
	* Produce correct output on empty ID3v1 tag.
	* Remove broken Id3v1.Tag.IsEmpty.
	* src/TagLib/Riff/List.cs: Make sure fields are cleared when SetValue
	* Clear value when null is passed in Riff.List.SetValue.
	* Make Riff.DivXTag.Clear clear the title.
	* Read genres correctly in Riff.MovieIdTag.
	* Complete codec descriptions for RIFF and ASF files.
	* Fix reading of UTF16-BE Id3v2.SynchronizedLyricsFrames.
	* Throw NotImplementedException for private frames in ID3v2.2.
	* Fix writing Id3v2.GeneralEncapulatedObjectFrame in UTF16.
	* Added support for multiple non-indexed artists in ID3v2.3
	* Correctly parse nil separated UTF-16BE strings.
	* Allow parsing of variable length years in Ape.Tag.
	* Fix writing of Mpeg4 files by correctly reading in values to
	  Mpeg4.FileParser.UtdaTree.
	* Allow parsing of all year lengths in Mpeg4.AppleTag and correctly
	  clear zeroed values.
	* Use Semicolons rather than commas in Tag.Joined* to reflect the
	  behavior of Windows Media Player.
	* Remove "WM/GenreID" from Asf.Tag when storing a new genre.
	* Switch ordering of check in looking for ASF content descriptors to
	  emphasize name rather than order.
	* Don't throw exception on zero byte strings in ByteVector.ToString ().
	* Use ContentDescriptionObject.Copyright in Asf.Tag.
	* Switch order of play_duration and send_duration in Asf.HeaderObject.
	  This is backwards from the specification but conforms to actual files.
	* Don't count preroll in ASF durations.
	* Don't double-count position when counting frames.
	* Ensure Id3v2.FrameHeader is converting headers from versions 2 and 3.
	* Always set the encoding to default in Id3v2.Tag when writing a frame
	  to prevent misencoding.
	* Stopped ArgumentOutOfRangeExceptions from occuring when corrupt
	  RelativeVolumeframe is encountered.
	* Fixed rendering of Ape.Item on non-latin characters.
	* Added new constructors to Picture to obsolete CreateFromFile,
	  CreateFromPath.
	* Changed Asf.Tag to write large pictures to the ASF Metadata Library
	  Object rather than ignoring them.
	* Changed the way Mpeg.AudioHeader checked for Xing identifier to
	  prevent first change exception if none was found.
	* Use StringBuilder instead of string addition.
	* Don't crash if Mpeg4.IsoHandlerBox does not contain a nil delimiter.
	* Limit scanning in Mpeg.AudioFile to 4096 bytes of audio stream to
	  prevent reading whole file if corrupt.
	* Replace protected CombinedTag constructor with public one to allow
	  compiling in Orcas.
	* Include MonoDevelop files in distributed package.
	* Correctly parse beats per minute when they contain floating point
	  numbers.

Added features:
	* Added support for Fraunhofer VBRI header. (Authored by hwahrmann.)
	* Obsoleted Tag.Duplicate in favor of Tag.CopyTo which can be extended
	  to provide better support for copying between matching tag types.
	* Added ByteVector.UseBrokenLatin1Behavior that when true reads tags
	  from the system encoding instead of Latin1.
	* Added support for reading APE files. (Authored by hwahrmann.)
	* Added generic Id3v2.GetFrames<T>() to reduce casting.
	* Added support for one of each type of cover image in Ape.Tag
	* Added recognition of BMP and GIF images in Picture.
	* Added Id3v2.PopularimeterFrame capable of handling ratings from
	  Windows Media Player.
	* Added Id3v2.Tag.UseNumericGenres which can be disabled to prevent
	  genres from being written as indices.
	* Added File.InvariantStartPosition and File.InvariantEndPosition to
	  mark the edges of the media portion of the file.

Version 2.0.0
June 11, 2007

This is the first stable release of TagLib#. TagLib# is a .NET 2.0 library for
reading and writing tagging data from audio and video files. In addition it
