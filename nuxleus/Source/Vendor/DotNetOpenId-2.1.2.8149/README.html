	<h2>
		Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		Before getting started, make sure you understand the 
		<a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html">OpenID Authentication 2.0 spec</a> and the OpenID
		<a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-simple-registration-extension-1_0.html">Simple Registration
		Extension 1.0</a>.
		Presentations and other explanatory resources are available from 
		<a href="http://openid.net/">http://openid.net/</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The current code base comes from a variety of original contributors:
		<ul>
			<li>The codebase for relying party and provider was originally ported from a JanRain
				library written in the .NET Boo language, which was itself a port from a Python
				version. Only a few traces remain of the original code as the code has been largely
				rewritten and refactored since then.</li>
			<li>The C# implementation comes from several people, chiefly these:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://hanselman.com/blog">Scott Hanselman</a> - original relying party port from Boo</li>
					<li><a href="http://jasona.net/">Jason Alexander</a> - original provider port from Boo</li>
					<li><a href="http://blog.nerdbank.net">Andrew Arnott</a> - ASP.NET Controls (OpenIDLogin and OpenIDTextBox
						classes), refactoring for our 1.0 version, and added OpenID 2.0 support for our
						2.0 version. And lots of tests.</li>
					<li>Several classes used in our crypto area were copied from the FOSS mono project.</li>
					<li><a href="willem.muller@netidme.com">Willem Muller</a> - original sample web projects, bit
						of work on server side implementation of Registration Extensions, this document,
						and few bug bugfixes </li>
				</ul>

		</ul>
	<h2>
		Getting the samples running</h2>
	<h3>
		Prerequisites:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>.NET 2.0</li>
		<li>Visual Studio 2008 or IIS</li>
		<li>Microsoft Windows (XP or Vista ought to work)</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=download">NUnit</a> 2.2.9 for .NET 2.0</li>
		<li>See the tools section further below for some helpful software </li>
	</ul>
	<h3>
		Testing the relying party/provider samples with each other</h3>
	<p>
		In this scenario you can use the Personal Web Server (PWS) that is included in Visual
		Studio 2008.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Open the DotNetOpenId.sln file in VS2008.</li>
		<li>Right-click on each web project under the Samples folder and click "View in Browser" to start PWS for each
			web site.</li>
		<li>Each web project will be dynamicly assigned a port number.&nbsp; Find the port 
			number on the URL of the browser window for the Provider.&nbsp; </li>
		<li>Now log into the Relying Party sample web site with this OpenID: 
			http://localhost:<i>providerport</i>/user/bob. </li>
		<li>When the provider prompts you for a password, type in &#39;test&#39;.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>
		Testing with other relying party/provider sites on the Internet</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>You need to have a public IP address to test the Provider sample with other 
			Relying Party web sites out on the Internet so they can find your Provider.&nbsp; </li>
		<li>You might need to configure your firewall and/or router to forward traffic to 
			your computer.</li>
		<li>Note that some OpenID-enabled sites block URLs that use just IP addresses.&nbsp; 
			You may need to get a DNS name to point at your public IP address in order for 
			your scenario to work.</li>
		<li>Ensure your firewall is configured to allow outbound calls to web ports.</li>
		<li>Since VS2008 Personal Web Server (PWS) does not allow web requests from other servers
			(as required by OpenID consumers trying to log into your server), testing with external
			consumers requires you to use IIS to host your server.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Setting up the IIS Applications</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Create an IIS web application for each sample.&nbsp; </li>
		<li>Check that IIS is responding to requests on the port that your router will be 
			forwarding requests to you on, if applicable.</li>
		<li>Enable anonymous access to each site.</li>
		<li>Set up URL rewriting.<ul>
			<li>This is the process of url conversion like: user/john ->user.aspx?username=john</li>
			<li>In IIS, go properties on the website (not the virtual directory)</li>
			<li>Go the Home Directory Tab and click Configuration</li>
			<li>Insert a wildcard extension </li>
			<li>Enter 'c:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_isapi.dll' for the executable</li>
			<li>Uncheck the 'Verify that file exists button'</li>
			<li>OK your way out of everything</li>
			<li>If you navigate to 'http://localhost:79/ProviderPortal/user/bob' you should see
			the text: 'OpenID identity page for bob'</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Note: These instructions work on IIS 6 with Windows 2003 Server. Other version of
		IIS (such as the one with windows XP - IIS 5.1) will vary. For IIS 5.1 , try follow
		instructions documented toward the end of this article: http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/URLRewriter.asp.
		If you still have issues (particularly if you get 404 when trying the demos or experience
		something like 
		<a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/group/microsoft.public.inetserver.iis/browse_thread/thread/386efa0bf596234b/ee1fab525c129071?lnk=st&amp;q=URLRewriter+IIS+XP+404&amp;rnum=2&amp;hl=en#ee1fab525c129071">
		this</a>)
		try this:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>create a file extension mapping for .openid files that maps to asp.net (c:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_isapi.dll)</li>
		<li>browse to .openid eg: http://IP/ProviderPortal/user/bob.openid</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Configure VS2008 to use IIS rather than PWS</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Right-click on one of the web projects within Solution Explorer.</li>
		<li>Select Property Pages.</li>
		<li>Select Start Options on the left.</li>
		<li>Under the Server section on the right, select Use Custom Server and fill in the
			Base URL.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>
		The demos</h2>
	<p>
		These will illustrate OpenID in action. You can debug the code to get a good idea
		of what's going on. The implementations are built on top of ASP.Net's forms authentication.
		So basically if you're unauthenticated and get to page requiring authentication,
		it takes you through the Open-ID identity provider, tracks in session that you've
		left and then recognizes the user when they return to the consumer and only then
		logs them into FormsAuth and redirects them to their orignally requested page.
	</p>
	<h3>
		The Relying Party Demo
	</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Kill all session cookies</li>
		<li>Create an OpenID account with one of the Open Servers listed below OR use the demo
			Server as the identity provider - using http://[EXTERNAL IP]/ProviderPortal/user/bob
			with the password 'test'</li>
		<li>Go to http://[EXTERNAL IP]/RelyingPartyPortal/default.aspx and enter the OpenIDURL</li>
		<li>You are required to authenticate with the provider. Some fields (eg Name, DoB, Country
			etc.) are requested, some required and some omitted. Your OpenID provider should
			prompt you for the relevant fields, or at least make you aware which fields its
			passing back. The exact page flow and auhentication mechanism will be implemented
			differently by different identity providers.</li>
		<li>After providing the required info and loggin in, you are taken back to the http://[EXTERNAL
			IP]/RelyingPartyPortal/default.aspx and the available profile information is displayed</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>
		The Provider Demo
	</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Kill all session cookies</li>
		<li>Get the full openID url for a user based on whats in web.config. By default you
			can use http://[EXTERNAL IP]/ProviderPortal/user/bob with the password 'test'</li>
		<li>Go to http://[EXTERNAL IP]/RelyingPartyPortal/default.aspx and enter the OpenIDURL of
			the local server</li>
		<li>The user is prompted for their password. The username field is propulated from the
			openid url and grayed out.</li>
		<li>The user is presentend with their identity url, a trust root (the site requiring
			authentication) and set of fields to complete. Only the requested or required fields
			are presented. Fields with * means the consumer requires it. </li>
		<li>The user completes the fields and clicks Yes and are taken to http://[EXTERNAL IP]/RelyingPartyPortal/default.aspx
			with their available profile information.</li>
	</ol>

		Development tips / Issues I found:</h3>
	<p>
		Here is a growing list of <a href="http://openiddirectory.com/allcats.html">

		</ul>
		* These sites seem to block outgoing traffic that is not on a non standard HTTP
		port like 80 and 443. Therefore you'll need to host on a proper internet domain
		before doing any testing with them.
	<p>
		Useful tools:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/">Fiddler</a> - this will allow you to monitor HTTP
				traffic when using IE</li>
