Getting Started with Mango
==========================

This is page two of the Getting Started with Mango tutorial.  It assumes you already have
Mango installed and have created the Hello World App from page one.


Templates Overview
------------------

Normally we want to spit out something other than just plain strings from our actions. Usually in a web
application we want to create HTML or maybe JSON.  Instead of forcing you to create these formats from hand,
Mango includes a powerful templating engine that can convert a .NET object into a document.
